# ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡© Anime Music Quiz Indonesian Localization ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡©
Recently, on patch 0.26.15, AMQ released support for site localization by loading a custom language translation file.<br>
The custom language translation file is a JSON file consisting of several variables set by Egerod and their values, which would be the content of some texts, buttons and menu inside the game.<br>

What we're doing here is basically editing those values and providing quality translations to the Indonesian-speaking AMQ community.
Of course, there are some terms that we're not translating such as "Novice Ranked" and "Quiz of the Day" to avoid confusion and disparity between the Indonesian players that rely on the translations and the global AMQ community.<br>

Currently, the localization feature itself covers limited aspect of the game and I expect it to cover more in the future. However, you are very welcome to experience the result of our initial work.<br>
To do so, you may go to Anime Music Quiz â†’ Go to the in-game setting â†’ Language â†’ Custom â†’ and paste this link onto the field ```https://files.catbox.moe/eudt1h.json``` â†’ Load.
